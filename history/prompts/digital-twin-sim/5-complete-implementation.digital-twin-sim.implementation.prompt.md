RESPONSE_TEXT: |
  Successfully completed implementation of Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation for Humanoid Robotics (Gazebo & Unity).

  Accomplishments:
  1. Created complete module structure with 3 comprehensive chapters and validation summary
  2. Implemented all functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-010) with full coverage
  3. Developed detailed technical content covering physics simulation, Unity interaction, and sensor simulation
  4. Created 3 conceptual diagrams: gazebo-physics-concepts.svg, unity-ros-communication.svg, sensor-simulation-data-flow.svg
  5. Enhanced accessibility and readability with darker font colors as requested
  6. Integrated with existing system including sidebar navigation and consistent styling
  7. Validated implementation with successful site build and navigation testing
  8. Ensured quality with academic standards, plagiarism check, and accessibility compliance

  The implementation fully addresses the need to create Module 2 explaining how digital twins enable safe, physics-accurate training and testing of humanoid robots before real-world deployment. All content meets academic standards with proper citations and is suitable for AI engineers and CS students building physics-based robotic simulations.
OUTCOME: "Module 2 successfully implemented with all requirements satisfied"
EVALUATION: "The implementation meets all functional requirements and quality standards, with proper integration into the existing documentation system"
