  Successfully updated the project constitution to version 1.3.0 to include AI/Robotics content standards for NVIDIA Isaac-based systems.

  Changes made:
  - Version bumped from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0 (minor version for new AI/Robotics content standards)
  - Modified principle IX (Documentation Standards) to include AI/robotics content requirements
  - Added new principle XI (AI/Robotics Content Standards) covering perception, navigation, and training systems
  - Updated Tech Stack Requirements to include NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 tools
  - Enhanced Development Workflow to include simulation-to-reality transfer testing
  - Updated Sync Impact Report at the top of the file

  The constitution now properly supports the development of Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) with specialized standards for:
  - Perception system documentation (synthetic data generation, training model validation)
  - Navigation content (path planning, humanoid mobility challenges)
  - Training content (simulation-to-reality transfer, hardware acceleration)
  - Integration content (ROS 2 compatibility, pipeline optimization)
OUTCOME: "Constitution successfully updated to support AI/Robotics content development"
EVALUATION: "Version 1.3.0 constitution includes all necessary provisions for NVIDIA Isaac-based AI/Robotics modules"
