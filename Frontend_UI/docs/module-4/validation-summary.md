# Module 4 Validation Summary

## Overview
This document provides validation and verification results for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. It covers the implementation of Whisper-based voice-to-action pipelines, LLM-powered cognitive planning, and end-to-end autonomous humanoid integration as specified in the feature requirements.

## Chapter Completion Status
- ✅ Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action Pipelines - Whisper-based speech input, intent extraction, ROS 2 command mapping
- ✅ Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs - translating natural language goals into ROS 2 action sequences
- ✅ Chapter 3: Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid - end-to-end system integrating navigation, perception, manipulation
